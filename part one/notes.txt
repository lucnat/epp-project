  Signal event selection
  ======================
  
  Muons:
    - min p_T = 20 GeV
    - abs(eta) < 2.1 (pseudorapidity)

  Electrons:
    - E_T > 30 GeV and abs(eta) < 2.5

  Exactly 1 isolated lepton
   -> rel. isolation < 0.05 for muons, and < 0.10 for electrons
  
  Jets:
    - At least one jet with p_T > 25 GeV and abs(eta) < 2.4
    - At least one jet b tagged
    - At least four jets

  Neutrino:
    - Missing transverse energy at least 20 GeV
